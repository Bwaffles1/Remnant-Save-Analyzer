# Remnant-Save-Analyzer
Using https://hzla.github.io/Remnant-World-Analyzer/ as base, here's an attempt to create a "watcher" that updates the list as soon as you reroll the campaign.

## Basic Info
- The app creates a FileSystemWatcher when you select a file.
- Updates the list when Remnant finishes writing the *.sav file (or whichever you selected).
- I believe this can be heavily improved, so any comment is appreciated.
- Hope this helps someone.
- Don't forget to thank the original author (hzla).
